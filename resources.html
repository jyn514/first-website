<h2>Security</h2>
  <p>A small list of easy and effective changes you can make today. If you have trouble with any of them, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and I'll add detail or instructions. <br>
     These links are meant to be as accessible as possible. This is a topic I feel strongly about - <a href="privacy.html">everyone should have the right to digital privacy.</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.keepassx.org">Use a password manager</a>: <br>
      <div class="tab">Generate random passwords, store them securely, and access them easily with a single master password. You'll stop using the same password for every site or trying to remember which you used. I recommend <a href="https://www.keepassx.org">KeePassX</a>, but there are options like <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> available as well.</div></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">Use <em>https</em> by default</a>:
      <br>
      <div class="tab">When you send a password to a website, it's vulnerable while in transit. Others on the network, connected to the same wifi, or with access to the receiving server can see your passwords. The solution is encryption. The <em style="font-family: Mono;">https://</em> protocol is a standard feature in the modern web, allowing behind-the-scenes encryption without requiring any configuration. Download the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">extension</a> to have all your pages use encryption automatically.</div></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Block trackers and persistant cookies</a>: <br>
      <div class="tab">Advertisers today, including Google Ads, track your browser for 'analytics' whenever you visit their page. Prevent companies you don't know from tracking you with <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>, a no-configuration necessary blocker. <br>Take note - this is not a traditional adblocker; it will allow ads if they don't set a tracker in your browser, and may block other tracking sites such as Facebook and Twitter if they follow you to other sites.</div></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Coding</h2>
  <p>The following links are resources for those interested in learning programming or web development. All are meant to be accessible with a bit of reading - please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you think it's badly organized or difficult to read, and I'll find some better resources.</p>
  <p>You don't need a career in programming to learn it; coding is <a href="python%20embed.html#loan">just as useful in everyday life</a>.</p>
  <p>The information here is loosely based on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">the Mozilla intro to web development</a>. I recommend following the order these are listed, but you are of course under no obigation to do so.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;"><a href="https://www.mozilla.org">What is Mozilla?</a></span></p>
  <ol>
    <li>If you've never used a text editor other than Word, you may want to check out Mozilla's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software">basic software</a> checklist.</li>
    <li>An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started">Introduction to HTML</a> from the makers of Firefox</li>
    <li>An introduction to the <a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/">Python programming language</a>, which I used for <a href="python%20embed.html">the apps</a> in this website.</li>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in further steps you can take to protect your privacy, the following take a bit more effort to set up or use, but are extremely effective.</a></p>
<!--bad copy-paste-->
  <ul>
    <li>PGP encryption through <a href="https://gnupg.org">the GNUPG program</a> allows all emails, texts, and files you send across the internet to only be accessible to those you choose. A picture encrypted with PGP could be uploaded to any server in the world without anyone being able to tell what it was.</li>
    <li>Anonymous internet browsing using <a href="https://torproject.org">TOR Browser</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://privacytoolsio.github.io/privacytools.io/">Information on Internet privacy</a>, hosted on github.com</li>
  </ul>
