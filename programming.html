    <p>Programming is an enormous discipline and a comprehensive list of
    resources would be near-impossible. However, I attempt to address all the
    most important points - enough to get you started.</p>
	
    <p>The following links are resources for those interested in learning
    programming or web development. All are meant to be accessible with a bit of
    reading - please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you think it's
    badly organized or difficult to read, and I'll find some better
    resources.</p>
	
    <p>You don't need a career in programming to learn it; coding is just as <a
    href="python%20embed.html#loan">useful in everyday life</a>.</p>
	
    <p>The information here is loosely based on <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">the Mozilla intro to
    web development</a>. I recommend following the order these are listed, but
    you are of course under no obigation to do so.

      <ol>
        <li><h3>A text editor</h3>
          This is perhaps the most important item here. Formatted text cannot
		  be parsed by almost any
          <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/compiler.html">compiler</a>
		  or browser. For general use, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">
		  Notepad++</a> (for Windows) or <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">
		  gedit</a> are excellent tools.</li>
		  
        <li><h3>A programming language</h3>
          There are dozens of different programming languages, many similar but
		  others quite different. If you ever want a laugh, look through Wikipedia's
		  list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">
		  esoteric languages</a>.
          For choosing a language, I recommend 
		  <a href="http://www.bestprogramminglanguagefor.me/">this site</a>.
		  Don't worry, programming skills tend to transfer from language to language.
		  </li>
		  
        <li><h3>A compiler</h3>
          This will vary based on your language. Here are some of the most common:
          <br /><br />

          <table><tr style="font-weight: bold">
		  <td>Language</td><td>Compiler</td><td>Notes</td></tr>

          <tr><td>Java</td><td><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a></td>
            <td>As Java is one of the most popular languages, there are many 
			different compilers. This one is an open-source and widely used.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>Python</td><td><a href="https://www.python.org">Official website</a></td>
            <td>Python has very different 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">
			syntax</a> from most languages. Because of this, it's much easier to
			learn than most. Python 3 is the 'modern' version, while Python 2 is
			used in most legacy code. The two, unfortunately, are rarely compatible.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>C#</td><td><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">Mono</a></td>
            <td>C# is a proprietary language owned by Microsoft. Mono is an 
			open-source implementation.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>HTML</td><td>Any web browser</td>
            <td>HTML is not a programming language as such. It is the source code
			for every webpage on the modern web. Complete pages usually have CSS
			and JavaScript as well.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>C++</td><td><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>
			</td><td>C++ is the modern version of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>,
			one of the oldest languages still used and certainly the most influential.
			As with Java, many different implementations exist.</td></tr>

        </table>

        <li><h3>Source control</h3>
          Source control is a way of keeping track of the changes you make to a
          document. See 
		  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control#_about_version_control">
          the git intro</a> for more info. <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>
          is one of the most popular versions of source control. You may also wish
          to upload to the cloud - <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> integrates
          very well with git for this.
