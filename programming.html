    <p>Programming is an enormous discipline and a comprehensive list of
    resources would be near-impossible. However, I attempt to address all the
      most important points - enough to get you started.</p>

    <p>If you know some programming - pretty much anything after hello world -
      this page is not for you. I recommend

                   description="Discussion of the different stages of learning">
      this article</a>.</p>
	
    <p>The following links are resources for those interested in learning
    programming or web development. All are meant to be accessible with a bit of
    reading - please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you think it's
    badly organized or difficult to read, and I'll find some better
    resources.</p>
	
    <p>You don't need a career in programming to learn it; coding is just as <a
    href="interactive.html#loan">useful in everyday life</a>.</p>
	
    <p>The information here is loosely based on <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">the Mozilla intro to
    web development</a>. I recommend following the order these are listed, but
    you are of course under no obigation to do so.

  <h2 id="language">Choosing a language</h2>
    <h3>What is a programming language?</h3>

    <h4>Basics</h4><p>Computers, as we all know, understand only `on` and `off`, often stylized as 'zeros and ones'
      <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">[1]</a></sup>.
    How then can we communicate with them, or do anything at all?
    A pre-built program, called a 'compiler'
      <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">[2]</a></sup>
    and built by much smarter minds than I, turns logical statements -
    `Do this; if this condition is true, do that` - into binary code,
    instructions the computer can understand.</p>

    <h4>Compilers</h4><p>What does this have to do with a language?
      The language you program in determines what statements you can make -
      you can only write code that a compiler can recognize and turn into
      binary statements. If you make a mistake, the compiler will throw an
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ro-ro/library/s9ek7a19(v=vs.80).aspx">
      error.</a> This can be anything from
      <a href="images/g_plus_plus_error.png" description="Running `g++` on a binary file">
      scrolling red text</a> to a simple <a href="images/python_error.png" description="Running programs that don't exist in Python">
      one-line message</a> to a <a href="images/gradle_error.png" description="Running `gradle test` on an empty class">
      detailed breakdown</a> of where your program went wrong.</p>

    <h4>Static and Dynamic</h4><p>Although all programs eventually are compiled
    to binary code, the experience can be very different depending on the language.
    Dynamic languages<sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/787239/what-is-a-dynamic-language-and-why-doesnt-c-sharp-qualify#answer-787253">[3]</a></sup>
    are more lenient - see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6xzcgb/is_n_in_javascript/" description="JavaScript is the DEVIL">
    here</a> for an example. Beginners tend to gravitate towards them because they're quicker
    to pick up and allow more errors. Static languages are much less forgiving, but also do much
    more of the work for you.</p>

    <h4>Choosing</h4><p>So, which language should you go with? Well, there are
    about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">200</a>
    in existence, so that's not as easy to answer as it might seem. I recommend
    <a href="http://www.bestprogramminglanguagefor.me/">this site</a> when first choosing.
    Don't worry, programming concepts tend to transfer between languages.</p>

    <h2 id="software">Basic <a href="resources.html#libre">Software</a></h2>
      <p>What software do you need to get started?</p>
      <ol>
        <li><h3>A text editor</h3>
          This is perhaps the most important item here. Formatted text cannot
		  be parsed by almost any
          <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/compiler.html">compiler</a>
		  or browser. For general use, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">
		  Notepad++</a> (for Windows) or <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">
		  gedit</a> are excellent tools.</li>

        <li><h3>Source control</h3>
          Source control is a way of keeping track of the changes you make to a document. See
		  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control#_about_version_control">
          the git intro</a> for more info. <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>
          is one of the most popular versions of source control. You may also wish
          to upload to the cloud - <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> integrates
          very well with git for this.
        </li>

        <li><h3>A compiler</h3>
          This will vary based on your language. Here are some of the most common:
          <br /><br />

          <table><tr style="font-weight: bold">
		  <td>Language</td><td>Compiler</td><td>Notes</td></tr>

          <tr><td>Java</td><td><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a></td>
            <td>As Java is one of the most popular languages, there are many 
			different compilers. This one is an open-source and widely used.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>Python</td><td><a href="https://www.python.org">Official website</a></td>
            <td>Python has very different 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">
			syntax</a> from most languages. Because of this, it's much easier to
			learn than most. Python 3 is the 'modern' version, while Python 2 is
			used in most legacy code. The two, unfortunately, are rarely compatible.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>C#</td><td><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">Mono</a></td>
            <td>C# is a proprietary language owned by Microsoft. Mono is an 
			open-source implementation.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>HTML</td><td>Any web browser</td>
            <td>HTML is not a programming language as such. It is the source code
			for every webpage on the modern web. Complete pages usually have CSS
			and JavaScript as well.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>C++</td><td><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>
			</td><td>C++ is the modern version of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>,
			one of the oldest languages still used and certainly the most influential.
			As with Java, many different implementations exist.</td></tr>
