<h3>About me:</h3>
  <p>My name is Joshua Nelson. I'm a college student at University of South Carolina studying Computer Science.
    More info is available <a href="about.html" title="More information about me and my interests">here</a>.</p>
  <p>
    This site is hosted under `first-website` on <a href="https://github.com/jyn514" title="Github is a repository for projects and code used by developers around the world.">my github page</a>. I have started several different projects, including:</p>

  </ol>
  <p>In particular, feel free to try <a href="python%20embed.html">my working projects</a>: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>My <a href="python%20embed.html#adventure" title="online compiler that runs the program without need for any downloads">text adventure</a>, coded in Python</li>
    <li>A simple <a href="python%20embed.html#guessing%20game">guess-the-number</a> game, inspired by <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/2DArray/you-find-yourself-in-a-room" title="Self-description: 'YFYIAR is the drunken uncle of text-based adventures: Abusive, abrasive, and maybe a little funny'"><em>You Find Yourself In A Room</em></a></li>
