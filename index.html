<h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>This page is still in development, but feel free to look around.</p>
<h3>About me:</h3>
  <p>My name is Joshua Nelson. I'm a college student at University of South Carolina
	studying Computer Science. More info is available 
	<a href="about.html" title="More information about me and my interests">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is hosted under `first-website` on <a href="https://github.com/jyn514"
		title="Github is a repository for projects and code used by developers around the world.">
		my github page</a>. I have started several different projects, including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/jyn514/reddit-bot"
		title="A simple bot for reddit using python and praw. Currently, redirects any post on /r/personalfiance to /r/personalfinance.">
		A reddit bot</a></li>
    <li>Various challenges from the site <a href="https://exercism.io">exercism.io</a></li>
    <li>A directory organiser, which I call 
		<a href="https://github.com/jyn514/classifier">Classifier</a>,
		forked from a similar project</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In particular, feel free to try <a href="python%20embed.html">
		my working projects</a>: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>My <a href="python%20embed.html#adventure" 
		title="online compiler that runs the program without need for any downloads">
		text adventure</a>, coded in Python</li>
    <li>A simple <a href="python%20embed.html#guessing%20game">guess-the-number</a>
		game, inspired by <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/2DArray/you-find-yourself-in-a-room"
		title="Self-description: 'YFYIAR is the drunken uncle of text-based adventures: Abusive, abrasive, and maybe a little funny'">
		<em>You Find Yourself In A Room</em></a></li>
    <li>A <a href="python%20embed.html#loan">loan calculator</a> that finds
		the monthly payment given the months or vice-versa.</li>
    <li><a href="python%20embed.html#hangman">Hangman!</a> Unfortunately, as of now,
		this game doesn't work in the browser when you play against the computer.
		You'll have to <a href="https://github.com/jyn514/python-challenges/blob/master/games/hangman.py">
		download it</a> to play, or play against a friend.</li>
  </ul>
