  <p>I am a college student in Columbia, South Carolina. I am studying 
	 Computer Science and plan to double major in Computer Engineering.</p>
  <p>I enjoy rock climbing, walking between classes, and a good meal.</p>
  <p>In my spare time, I play piano and sing, create projects like this one,
	 and plan elaborate designs for computer programs I want to make in the future.
	 <sup>I also browse reddit, don't tell anyone</sup></p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>My father is a Navy veteran who ran his own company fixing computers for more
		than 20 years, from when I was born until my Junior year of high school.
        He sold the company recently and it is now defunct.
        He now sells cloud-management software to Fortune 500 companies, working for
		<a href="https://www.riverbed.com/">Riverbed Solutions</a>.
        He is the hardest-working person I have ever had the pleasure to meet.
        I respect him immensely, and I decided to study computers partly because of him.
        My hope is to eventually be wealthy enough to support him, so he no longer
		has to work so hard.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>I taught myself programming from January 2017 to August 2017, as can be seen
		from my <a href="https://github.com/jyn514">github commits</a>. I started with 
		<em>very</em> basic programs: multiplying two inputs, hello-world in Java,
		factoring a given number. Originally, I commited each change to github directly
		using its web-editor. I eventually downloaded 
		<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html">Idle</a> 
		and edited my python programs from the desktop.</p>

    <p>Currently, I use <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> for Java, 
		<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for Python, and 
		<a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> for this site.
        I have a working knowledge of git, enough that I can use it but not enough to
		keep my git history from looking like a mess.
        For personal projects, I try to commit at least once for every day I edit.
        Depending on my time, I may upload some of my school assignments.</p>

    <p>I keep all my old code on github as a reminder of how far I've come. 
		Little of it from before Summer 2017 is indicative of my current skill.</p>

<h2>Internships</h2>
    <p>I am looking for an internship in any technical or programming position.
        If you are interested, please see my school-sponsored 
		<a href="https://sc.joinhandshake.com/users/6994356"> career profile</a>
