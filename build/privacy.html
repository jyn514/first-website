<h1>Why Privacy?</h1>
    <p>Some of you may be wondering why I dedicated a large part of this site to 
		<a href="resources.html#privacy">privacy resources</a>. It seems silly
		after all - why should we care what the NSA is doing? That stuff is all
		paranoid, and more than a hassle than anything else.</p>
		
    <p>I agree. We all knew when we got a new phone that it would be 
		<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline">tracking our location</a>,
		<a href="https://myactivity.google.com/page?page=devices">uploading
		our calendars and contacts</a>, and 
		<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/">storing data about
		our preferences and actions</a> in remote servers. We accepted it as
		the price of living in the modern world, of having a self-updating map
		at the tip of our fingers, of contacting people across the world at the
		speed of light.</p>
		
    <p>But it doesn't have to be. We don't <em>have to</em> accept 
		<a href="https://delivery.panerabread.com/#!/cafeLocations/">
		websites tracking our location</a>, or 
		<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/logins">
		the time and location</a> of all our logins and 
		<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity">which devices
		we use</a> every time we access the web.</p>
