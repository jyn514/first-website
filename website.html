<h3>About me:</h3>
  <p>My name is Joshua Nelson. I'm a student in Tampa, FL, who's learning to program in his spare time. I currently work a summer job in Tampa, FL, and I am going to college in the fall.</p>
  This site is hosted under `first-website` on <a href="https://github.com/jyn514" title="Github is a repository for projects and code used by developers around the world.">my github page</a>. I have started several different projects, including:
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/jyn514/reddit-bot" title="A simple bot for reddit using python and praw. Currently, redirects any post on /r/personalfiance to /r/personalfinance.">A reddit bot</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/jyn514/python-challenges/tree/master/games" title="These games include hangman, guess-the-number, and Tic-Tac-Toe (in progress)">A few simple games</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/jyn514/python-challenges/tree/master/MIT%20Intro%20to%20CS" title="For info about this course, visit https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/">A Computer Science course</a>, organized by MIT</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In particular, feel free to try <a href="python%20embed.html">my working projects</a>: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>My <a href="python%20embed.html#adventure" title="online compiler that runs the program without need for any downloads">text adventure</a>, coded in Python.</li>
    <li>A simple <a href="python%20embed.html#guessing%20game">guess-the-number</a> game, inspired by <a href="www.kongregate.com/games/2DArray/you-find-yourself-in-a-room">this game</a></li>
    <li>A <a href="python%20embed.html#loan">loan calculator</a> that finds the monthly payment given the months or vice-versa.</li>
    <li><a href="python%20embed.html#hangman">Hangman!</a> Unfortunately, as of now, this game doesn't work in the browser when you play against the computer. You'll have to <a href="https://github.com/jyn514/python-challenges/blob/master/games/hangman.py">download it</a> to play, or play against a friend.</li>
